    "##### In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which interrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions are raised when a statement or expression cannot be executed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, a ZeroDivisionError exception will be raised, since dividing by zero is not a valid operation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exceptions in Python are a way to handle unexpected events and errors that can occur during program execution. By using exception handling, you can gracefully handle these errors and take appropriate actions, such as displaying an error message to the user or logging the error for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the Python interpreter cannot understand the code you have written. These errors are typically caused by mistakes such as misspelled keywords, missing parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur before the program is executed, while exceptions occur during program execution. Syntax errors are usually easier to spot and fix, since the Python interpreter will display an error message indicating the specific line where the error occurred. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be more difficult to diagnose, since they can occur in many different parts of the code, and may not be immediately obvious to the developer."
